INTRODUCTION


BUSINESS CASE

DATASETS USED

METHODOLOGIES
Data Collection:
Collect and compile data from flat files, web scraping, APIs, and big data systems.
Ensure the data collected covers aspects such as cycling accidents, purchases, discussions, infrastructure, routes, and usage patterns.
Data Cleaning and Wrangling:
Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the collected datasets.
Standardize data formats and resolve any data quality issues.
Implement advanced data cleaning techniques, such as using machine learning algorithms for imputing missing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distributions, trends, and relationships within the data.
Identify key factors influencing female cyclists' behavior and preferences.
Feature Engineering:
Create new features or derive meaningful metrics from the existing data to enhance predictive modeling or analysis.
Machine Learning:
Implement machine learning models to forecast financial trends related to female cycling, enabling predictive analysis and strategic planning.
Data Visualization:
Visualize the findings from the EDA phase using charts, graphs, and maps to communicate insights effectively.
Create visualizations that highlight differences and trends specific to female cyclists in France.
Statistical Analysis:
Apply statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify significant patterns or correlations.
Conduct hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about female cyclists' preferences and behaviors.
Explore time series analysis to understand seasonal variations in cycling behavior among women.
Financial Application:
Apply portfolio optimization techniques to optimize investment decisions in cycling-related ventures, considering factors such as risk tolerance and return objectives.
Conduct risk assessment and scenario analysis to identify potential financial risks associated with cycling investments and develop mitigation strategies accordingly.
Dashboard Development:
Develop interactive dashboards using visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.
Include key metrics, trends, and recommendations for the sporting goods store based on the analysis.
Predictive Modeling (Optional for Data Analytics):
Build predictive models, such as regression or classification models, to forecast demand for specific bike products among female customers.
Evaluate model performance and refine models based on feedback and additional data.
